<!-- This program simulates landing near a farm scene from the
	perspective of a plane. Upon pushing 'n', the next frame
	is triggered, in which the position of the plane is changed
	by a constant amount in the Y and Z directions. Also, we
	added the option to zoom out from the scene by pushing 'd'
	to decrement the frame.
